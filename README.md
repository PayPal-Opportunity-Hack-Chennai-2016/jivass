Designing an E-Waste Marketplace

Intends to make a dual impact to society that could not only protect the environment but also increase opportunities for vendors and scavengers dealing with e-Waste. They need a way to build a catalogue of ewaste along with a pricing service that could offer instant price of electronic waste material based on their brand, condition, quantity and SKU details like barcode. The extension is an auction portal and a measurement tool that could help measure the impact created by this service.
